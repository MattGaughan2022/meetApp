## Event App

The Event App will store a list of activities in various cities to allow the user to make a psuedo to-do list for when they are visiting on specific dates.

### User Stories

As a user, I should be able to show or hide event details in order to show more/less specific information about an event.

As a user, I would like to specify the number of events listed so that I can limit how many events are listed.

As a user, I should be able to use the app when offline so that I can still access a list of events I found or created before.

As a user, I should be able to add an app shortcut to the home screen so that I can visit the app and view information faster.

As a user, I should be able to see charts with event details to show certain information (which city) faster with visuals

### Use of Serverless Functions

Serverless functions allow for easy integration and deployment of smaller app functions, as well as offloading the need for a custom server just to perform simple tasks that other companies sell the server space for.

This app will utilize a map function from a cloud host to display locations of events, or the area around a user-searched city. This map can be toggled by the user to have more room for viewing lists of events.
